/**
 * Title: Sum of Array Pairs
 * 
 * Exercise Description:
 * 
 * You are developing a utility for a financial application where you need to analyze pairs of transactions. One of the features
 * requested is to find pairs of numbers in an array that add up to a specific target sum. Your goal is to write a JavaScript function
 * that takes an array of numbers and a target sum, and returns an array of all unique pairs of numbers that add up to the target sum.
 * Each pair should be represented as an array of two elements.
 * 
 * Input and Output Examples:
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 6
 * Output: [[1, 5], [2, 4]]
 * Explanation: The pairs 1+5 and 2+4 add up to the target sum of 6.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: arr = [2, 4, 3, 3, 5, 7], target = 6
 * Output: [[2, 4], [3, 3]]
 * Explanation: The pairs 2+4 and 3+3 add up to the target sum of 6.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: arr = [1, 1, 1, 1], target = 2
 * Output: [[1, 1]]
 * Explanation: The pair 1+1 adds up to the target sum of 2.
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], target = 10
 * Output: []
 * Explanation: There are no pairs that add up to the target sum of 10.
