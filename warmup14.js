/**
 * Title: Palindrome Checker
 * 
 * Exercise Description:
 * 
 * You are a software engineer working on a text processing application. One of the features requested by your users
 * is the ability to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence
 * of characters that reads the same backward as forward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Your goal is to write
 * a JavaScript function that takes a string and returns `true` if the string is a palindrome and `false` otherwise.
 * 
 * Input and Output Examples:
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: str = "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization, the string reads the same backward as forward.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: str = "racecar"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The string "racecar" reads the same backward as forward.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: str = "hello"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The string "hello" does not read the same backward as forward.
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * Input: str = "No 'x' in Nixon"
 * Output: true
 * explanation: Ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization, the string reads the same backward as forward.
